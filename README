This is a simple tool for finding and extracting urls from Internet Explorer session restore data (binary restore files).
It will also find page titles for *.html pages.
Where 'Strings' fails, this tool succeeds. 

Usage:
For use on Windows Vista or Windows 7.
*Internet Explorer can not be open when this script is run; it will cause a permission error when reading the restore files.*

python IE-Recovery-Data-Parser.py -d [Abosute directory to search] -f [Filename of XML file to save]

Called without arguments, it will search the drive of the current working directory for the standard IE recovery folder location and will output "IE_History.xml".
Additionally, the without the -d argument, there will be a "User" field in the XML, which could be helpfull on a machine with many users.

Dependencies:
Python 2.7.2 - http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/
