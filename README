This is a simple tool for finding and extracting urls from Internet Explorer session restore data (binary restore files).
Where 'Strings' fails, this tool succeeds. 

Usage:
python main.py -d [Abosute directory to search] -f [Filename of XML file to save]
Called without arguments, it will search the drive of the current working directory for the standard IE recovery folder location and will output "IE_History.xml".

Dependencies:
Python 2.7.2 - http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/
OleFileIO - http://www.decalage.info/python/olefileio
